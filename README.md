This full-stack site is developed for an organization that wants to do this volunteer works. A user can participate in any Voluntarily
event. 

    1.Users can participate in any event by registering as a volunteer. 
    2.Users can choose any Voluntarily event with selected dates. 
    3.There is an admin panel for viewing upcoming events and who are participating in those events.
    4.Admin can create new events.
    5.Admin can remove any volunteer from any events 

I used ReactJS, React Router, Firebase Authentication for user/ admin login. NodeJS and MongoDB are used for backend services. And Bootstrap,Material-UI, HTML, CSS used for designing the site.
